# 2D-Group-Project

Hi Team, (Joseph) I will be absent Monday the 30 due to sickness. I have run a fever over 100 on meds for the entire day. I am writing this to remind you guys what were working on just incase you finish a project or just forgot.
Trayson if you could finish the boss level to the best of your ability that would be great. In the event that it is complete find another mechanic to work on such as adding difficulty scaling or some form of settings. As a last resort you could start designing the second level
NOT the CAVE!
Elle if you could finish as many player animations as possible that would be great. I had made a list of the necessary animations for the player on Trello. If you have completed all the player animations I trust you to pick some art project to work on, possibly enemy sprites.
All that I ask is the you DO NOT do tilemaps. I am going to do my best to work from home and that is something that is easy for me to do. 

Sidenote, if I work at all it will be within the Cave(Level 1) scene or my test scene. I will not be editing and code nor sprites. So just plan to work arround that so we dont have any errors.
